# PRODIGY_CS_02 – Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

## 🔐 Objective
Create a simple program to encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating their pixels using Python.

## ⚙ How It Works
- *Encryption:* Adds a secret key value to each pixel's RGB channels.
- *Decryption:* Subtracts the same key value to retrieve the original image.

## 📁 Files Included
- encrypt_decrypt.py — Python script to encrypt and decrypt images.
- sample_input.png — The original image used as input.
- encrypted.png — The encrypted image output.
- decrypted.png — The decrypted image output (should match original).
- README.md — This file.

## 🛠 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Install Pillow library:
   ```bash
    python -m pip install pillow
3. Run the script:
   PIL import Image.txt
